  Cascading Sytle Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
  presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often
  used to set the visual style of Web pages and user interfaes written in HTML
  and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document including plain XML,
  SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, for on other media. ALong
  with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites
  to create visually engaing webpages, user interfaces for web applications,
